Hi, Iâ€™m My name is Joseph Millward (@JosephMillwardStats)

I am a current senior researcher at Johns Hopkins University focusing on public health and economics. My day-to-day work primarily focuses on 
planning, implementation and analysis of national and subnational surveys, as well as data visualization and dashboard development for public health data. 
I also work on economic evaluation of health and education programs, and have conducted research in health economics.

I am currently aiming to improve my skills in data visualization and dashboard development, and further have specific interest in developing machine learning 
skills in R and/or Python. I am also open to collaborting with others on public health research and health economics/ economic development research.
